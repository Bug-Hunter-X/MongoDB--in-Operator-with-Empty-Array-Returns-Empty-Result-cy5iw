# MongoDB $in Operator with Empty Array

This repository demonstrates a common yet easily overlooked error in MongoDB queries: using the `$in` operator with an empty array.  While seemingly harmless, this query does not return all documents, resulting in unexpected behavior.

The `bug.js` file showcases the incorrect usage, and `bugSolution.js` provides the correct approach.  This illustrates the importance of careful consideration when working with array operators in MongoDB.

## Usage

1.  Ensure you have MongoDB installed and running.
2.  Clone this repository.
3.  Run the scripts using your preferred Node.js environment.  Be sure to replace `<your_collection>` with the name of your collection.
